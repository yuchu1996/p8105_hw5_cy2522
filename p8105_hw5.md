### data cleaning

``` r
## import data and clean data
sdy_df = 
    tibble(file_name = list.files(path = "./data/")) %>% 
    mutate(subject_df = map(str_c("./data/", file_name), ~read_csv(.x))) %>% 
    unnest() %>%
    separate(file_name, into = c("group", "id"), sep = "_") %>% 
    gather(key = week, value = value, week_1:week_8) %>% 
    mutate(id = factor(str_replace(id, ".csv", "")),
        week = as.numeric(str_replace(week, "week_", "")))

### making plots about the study

``` r
##spaghetti plot 
sdy_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = group)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = id)) +
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  facet_grid(.~ group) +
  labs(
    title = "spaghetti plot of observations on each subject over time",
    x = "week",
    y = "study value"
  ) +
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Location", 
    discrete = TRUE)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'
