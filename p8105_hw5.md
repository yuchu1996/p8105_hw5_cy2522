### making plots about the study

``` r
##spaghetti plot 
sdy_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, color = group)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = id)) +
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  facet_grid(.~ group) +
  labs(
    title = "spaghetti plot of observations on each subject over time",
    x = "week",
    y = "study value"
  ) 
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

problem 2
=========

### import data

``` r
## import the data
homicide_df = read.csv("./homicide-data.csv") 

## new variable
homicide_num = homicide_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city,",", state)) %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  summarise(total_num = n(),
            unsolved_num = sum(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest")))
```

### For the city of Baltimore, MD

``` r
## filer the baltimore MD
bd_df = homicide_num %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore,MD")

## prop.test
bd_prop = prop.test(bd_df$unsolved_num, bd_df$total_num)

## tidy
broom::tidy(bd_prop) %>%
  select(estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "stats table of Baltimore MD", digits = 4)
```

|  estimate|  conf.low|  conf.high|
|---------:|---------:|----------:|
|    0.6456|    0.6276|     0.6632|

### for each of the cities in dataset

``` r
homicide_prop = homicide_num %>%
  mutate(prop 
         = map2(.x = unsolved_num, .y = total_num, ~broom::tidy(prop.test(.x,.y)))) %>%
  unnest() %>%
  select(city_state,estimate, conf.low, conf.high) 
```

    ## Warning in prop.test(.x, .y): Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect

    ## Warning in prop.test(.x, .y): Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect

### creating a plot

``` r
homicide_prop %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = estimate,x = reorder(city_state, estimate))) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(x = city_state, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  labs(
    title = "scatterplot of the estimates and CIs for each city",
    x = "city and state name",
    y = "proportion of unsolved crimes "
  ) +
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```
